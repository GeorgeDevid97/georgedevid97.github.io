            Moose are one of the northern hemisphere’s largest land mammals and
            the largest members of the deer family. Their coloring ranges from
            brown to a dusky black depending on the animal’s age and the time of
            year, with calves often a light rusty coloring. Moose have long
            legs, the front legs being longer than the back ones. Their snout is
            long and they have a droopy bottom lip and a shoulder hump. Under
            their chin is a flap of skin that is like a bird’s wattle. Their
            tail is short and each foot has two large toes with hooves and two
            smaller toes. They can move fast, even in the wet and mud. Their two
            large toes spread widely apart to stop them from sinking.

          <h2>Distribution</h2>
          <p>
            Moose inhabit northern North America. They are found throughout
            Canada, Alaska, the northeastern United States, and right down in
            Colorado in the Rocky Mountains. They are also found in large
            numbers in northern European countries and throughout Russia. Some
            populations of moose (especially in Europe) migrate, however, others
            remain in one area throughout the year. Moose typically inhabit
            boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. They can
            also be found near swamps, lakes, rivers, and wetlands, in open
            country in the lowlands and mountains, including farmland, if there
            is a forest nearby.

          <h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>
          <p>
            Moose are active during the day. They tend to be solitary, the
            strongest bonds developed between mother and calf. Sometimes two
            individuals will feed at the same stream. Herds are usually seen
            during the breeding season but may contain only two adults. A moose
            is able to run at 35 miles per hour (56km/h) and easily swims 10
            miles. They will rest in shallow water to cool off or to escape from
            biting insects. They rely on their good sense of smell, as they have
            poor eyesight. Often, while eating, moose will suddenly stop to
            listen out for any threats. You can tell if a moose might attack
            when the long hairs on the hump are raised and the ears are laid
            back.

          <h2>Population</h2>
          <h3>Population threats</h3>
          <p>
            Habitat degradation and hunting are the major threats. Calves and
            ill or elderly moose are preyed upon. The main predators are large
            carnivores, including humans, wolves, black bears, and grizzly
            bears. Moose are hunted for meat as well as for sport and as an
            ecotourism activity. They are not listed as endangered or threatened
            on national or global levels, but in Michigan, they are listed as a
            species of special concern.
          </p>
          <h3>Population number</h3>
          <p>
            According to Wikipedia specific moose populations have been
            estimated in such areas: Moose population in North America: in
            Canada - 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals. In the United States
            around 300,000 individuals. Moose population in Europe and Asia:
            Finland - 115,000 individuals. Norway - 120,000 moose. Latvia -
            21,000 moose. Estonia - 13,260 moose. Poland - 2,800 individuals.
            Czech Republic - 50 moose. Russia - 730, 000 individuals. Sweden -
            Summer population is estimated to be 300,000 - 400,000 moose. Around
            100,000 are shot each fall. Overall, currently, moose are classified
            as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List and their numbers today
            are increasing.
          </p>
          <h3>Ecological Niche</h3>
          <p>
            Through browsing, moose have a dramatic effect on plant communities
            and may inhibit the reforestation of pine and spruce forests, thus
            having a possible negative effect on the timber industry. Moose are
            hunted for sport and for meat, including as an ecotourism activity.

          <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
          <p>
            Moose are herbivorous animals and they eat birch and aspen twigs,
            sedges, horsetail, roots, grasses, and pond weeds. They eat leaves,
            buds, twigs, and bark from some woody plants, also lichens, aquatic
            plants, and several of the taller herbaceous plants that grow on
            land. Moose are able to forage for aquatic plants both under and on
            the water.

          <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
          <p>
            Moose breed in September and October. The males are polygynous and
            will seek several females to breed with. During this time both sexes
            will call to each other. Males produce heavy grunting sounds that
            can be heard from up to 500 meters away, while females produce
            wail-like sounds. Males will fight for access to females. Female
            moose have an eight-month gestation period, usually bearing one
            calf, or twins if food is plentiful, in May or June. Newborn moose
            have fur with a reddish hue in contrast to the brown appearance of
            an adult. The young are weaned 5 months after birth but will stay
            with the mother until just before the next young are born. Moose
            become reproductively mature when they are 2 years old and are fully
            grown at 4 or 5.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This species is called a "moose" in North American English, but an
            "elk" in British English. The word "elk" in North American English
            refers to a completely different species of deer, also called the
            wapiti (Cervus canadensis).
          </li>
          <li>
            Male moose have antlers like other members of the deer family and
            females typically select mates based on antler size. Interestingly
            that moose with antlers have more acute hearing than those without
            antlers.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the mating season males drop their antlers to conserve energy
            for the winter. A new set of antlers will then regrow in the spring.
            Antlers take three to five months to fully develop, making them one
            of the fastest-growing animal organs. Birds, carnivores, and rodents
            eat dropped antlers as they are full of protein, and moose
            themselves will eat antler velvet for the nutrients.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fur of these animals consists of two layers; the top layer of
            long guard hairs and a soft wooly undercoat. The guard hairs are
            hollow and filled with air for better insulation, which also helps
            moose stay afloat when swimming
          </li>
          <li>
            Moose lack upper front teeth but have eight sharp incisors on the
            lower jaw. Their upper lip is very sensitive and helps distinguish
            between fresh shoots and harder twigs; it is also prehensile, for
            grasping food. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small
            saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth, or body. For larger
            trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs,
            allowing it to reach branches up to 4.26 meters (14.0 ft) or higher
            above the ground!
          </li>
          <li>
            A typical moose, weighing 360 kg (794 lb), can eat up to 32 kg (71
            lb) of food per day.
